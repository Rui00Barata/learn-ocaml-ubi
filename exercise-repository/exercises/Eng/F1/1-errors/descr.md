Evaluate the following expressions, observe the resultant error messages and propose a correction, i.e., a correct expression that solves the detected problems.

- `let quarter_pi = 3.14 / 4.`
- `let in_order = 1 < 2 < 3` 
- `let positive = let a = 42 in if a >= 0 then true`
- `let double_positive = let x = cos 5. in (if (x < 0) then x else -x) *. 2`
