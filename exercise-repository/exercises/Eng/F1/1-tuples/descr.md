Consider the following definition: `let n1 = (1,2,3,4,5)`

How to access exclusively to the fourth element of `n1`?

A) `n1[3]`<br/>
B) `n1[4]`<br/>
C) `let a,b,c,d,e = n1`<br/>
D) `let a,b,c,_,e = n1`<br/>
E) `let _,_,_,a,_ = n1`<br/>

**Note:** If you believe that the correct option is `A` then you should answer as follows: `let answer = A`.
